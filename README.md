
# Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Record (EHR) Management System

## Overview

The *Blockchain-Based EHR System* is designed to solve major challenges in India’s healthcare system, such as mismanagement of patient records, lack of interoperability, and security concerns. This decentralized application leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, immutable, and transparent storage of medical records, while also allowing patients to have complete control over who accesses their health data.

The system integrates modern technologies like *Ethereum blockchain, **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and **Web3.js* for building a decentralized, scalable, and secure platform. The application is compliant with Indian privacy laws, particularly the *Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) 2023, and integrates with the **Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA)* to enhance healthcare delivery in both urban and rural settings.

## Features

•⁠  ⁠*Decentralized Record Management: Secure storage of medical records on a decentralized blockchain platform, accessible across multiple nodes using **IPFS*.
  
•⁠  ⁠*Patient-Controlled Access: Patients control access to their health data, granting permissions to authorized healthcare providers using the **ABHA* identifier.

•⁠  ⁠*Secure Data Sharing*: All medical data is stored immutably, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or tampering.

•⁠  ⁠*Seamless Interoperability*: Simplifies medical data sharing between healthcare providers, improving coordination and patient care.

•⁠  ⁠*Optimized Treatment*: Healthcare providers have access to a patient’s complete medical history, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment.

## Tech Stack

•⁠  ⁠*Ethereum Blockchain: We use **Ganache* for local blockchain development and *Solidity* for smart contract development to manage access permissions and other key functionalities.
  
•⁠  ⁠*IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)*: Decentralized storage for patient records, ensuring data security and resilience.

•⁠  ⁠*Web3.js*: JavaScript library for integrating the Ethereum blockchain with the web application.

•⁠  ⁠*React.js*: Frontend framework for building a responsive and user-friendly interface for patients, healthcare providers, and labs.
